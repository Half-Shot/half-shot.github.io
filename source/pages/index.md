Hey, I'm Half-Shot and this is a sort of dump of personal stuff.

I've (after countless iterations over the years) got a blogging system working over at [/blog](/blog/index) but it's mostly me talking about either one of my projects, matrix, or how cool ace attorney is.

If you want the source code for this site (for whatever twisted purpose), you can grab it from [this Github  Repo](https://github.com/Half-Shot/half-shot.uk). The site is written in JS (node), and builds statically using mustache, sass and markdown. I'm not making this into it's own project, but it is very 'copy paste-able' ;)
