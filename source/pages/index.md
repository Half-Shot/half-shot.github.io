Hey, I'm Half-Shot and this is a sort of dump of personal stuff.

I've (after countless iterations over the years) got a blogging system working over at [/blog](/blog/index) but it's mostly me talking about either one of my projects, matrix, or how cool ace attorney is. Oh and there is probably some light furry content but I try to keep it tasteful.

I'll probably put something more useful on the index at some point, but for now this is all yer getting.

### Projects
* :fa-folder: [Matrix MPD DJ](https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-mpd-dj)
* :fa-folder: [Matrix Python SDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk) (contributations)
* :fa-exclamation-triangle: (Need to put on Github) Attorney Engine - Free Software game engine in C#
