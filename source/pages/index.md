Hey, I'm Half-Shot and this is a sort of dump of personal stuff.

I've (after countless iterations over the years) got a blogging system working over at [/blog](/blog/index) but it's mostly me talking about either one of my projects, matrix, or how cool ace attorney is. Oh and there is probably some light furry content but I try to keep it tasteful.

I'll probably put something more useful on the index at some point, but for now this is all yer getting.
