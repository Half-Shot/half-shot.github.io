Hey, I'm Half-Shot and this is a sort of dump of personal stuff.

I've (after countless iterations over the years) got a blogging system working over at [/blog](/blog/index) but it's mostly me talking about either one of my projects, matrix, or how cool ace attorney is. Oh and there is probably some light furry content but I try to keep it tasteful.

If you want the source code for this site (for whatever twisted purpose), you can grab it from [this Github  Repo](https://github.com/Half-Shot/half-shot.uk). The site is written in JS (node), and builds statically using mustache, sass and markdown. I'm not making this into it's own project, but it is very 'copy paste-able' ;)
