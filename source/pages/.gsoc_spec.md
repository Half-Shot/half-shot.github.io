## Change Log

- 8/5/16
    - Completed 'like' event.

## Terms

**Stream Room / SR** - The room in which the user has designated to be their 'stream', which includes all their posts and where other people will send events related to the user such as likes.

## Event Types

### like

The 'like' event is a simple room event which is related to any post event. It should be accumulated with other likes on the same event to show a 'like count' for a post. This event can be redacted to unlike a post at a later time.

| Name          | Expected Type | Description                           |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |       
| **type**      | string        | Always "org.halfshot.bark.like".      |
| **event_id**  | string        | The globally unique event identifier. |
| **related_to**| string        | The post event the user liked.        |
| **sender**    | string        | Contains the fully-qualified ID of the user who sent this event. |
| **room_id**   | string        | This room id should be the same as the SR |

#### Example

```
 {
    "type":"org.halfshot.bark.like",
    "event_id":"$146271051612687qlVIS:half-shot.uk",
    "sender": "@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk",
    "related_to":"$146271083312688bUGFr:half-shot.uk",
    "room_id": "!UcYsUzyxTGDxLBEvLz:matrix.org"
 }
```

### repost

The 'repost' event is basically a redirect to another event in another persons SR. The "related_to" field should be resolved when encountered and the body of that event should be shown in place of this event, with the appropriate formatting to show it is a repost.

| Name                | Expected Type | Description                           |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |       
| **type**            | string        | Always "org.halfshot.bark.repost".    |
| **event_id**        | string        | The globally unique event identifier. |
| **related_to**      | string        | The post event the user reposted.     |
| **related_to_room** | string        | The room id of the SR the repost is related to |
| **sender**          | string        | Contains the fully-qualified ID of the user who sent this event. |
| **room_id**         | string        | This room id should be the same as the *reposters* SR. |
