Matrix Idea List
================

Every day I think of another stupid idea which I want to make a matrix bot/service for. (Some of them may be sensible)

* A bot that will generate a meme given a meme code, and some text.
* A bot that will give a random cute animal gif when somebody writes enough ':(' faces.
* A bot for steam profiles and random stats
* A bot that will give a random fact about the querying user.
* A service that allows me to enter a pokemon battle with any user.  
* Polls! Dude, we NEED them.
