Bark: Microblogging in Matrix
===================================
##### By Will "Half-Shot" Hunt

Matrix seems like the ideal framework on which to build a microblogging system. In essence, a microblog is just a selective messaging application where you choose who you subscribe to. I plan to create a full implementation of a microblog (using examples such as Twitter and Google Plus as an influence on it's look) on top of Matrix. This involves building a structure to accommodate features such as ‘replying’, 'following' and a ‘central timeline' inside a client, to make it usable for everyone.

I have a huge interest in building a distributed service similar to existing microblogs, and 'Bark' is basically the opportunity I have to prove that one is viable, while also proving that Matrix is so much more than just a group messaging system to the masses.

## Why Microblog in Matrix

- Matrix is very well suited to a subscription system similar to how other microblogging systems work.
- Distributed messaging is something most microblogs don’t offer,but is something users would be interested in.
- Matrix has a wide variety of clients/libraries already, so this will not restrict the user on what tools they use.
- By hosting a homeserver, you can offer a much greater degree of privacy. Your messages are not stored in a single database, but in many servers which can apply different security settings per room.

## Design

### Rooms

Rooms will act as a user’s stream. Every user that joins Bark will create a single room on their homeserver which would serve as their personal ‘timeline’. They can post to it and allow/deny other users access to it. This gives the stream owner some flexibility about allowing people to read their posts and if they want people to 'write on' their stream.

A user may set their biography (a small piece of text about themselves) as their room topic. Following a user would be as simple as joining their room.
Replying to a user’s post would be as simple as sending two messages. The first would be '>replying to:eventid' where the eventid is the previous message. Secondly, sending the reply body.

This should allow for other clients to understand what is being said even if they don't understand the microblog format.

Room naming is more tricky due to the variety of permissions that users may be allowed. The Bark client will create a room for the user on their homeserver (this would be a requirement) upon login to the client if it does not exist. The rooms name would be 'Bark - DisplayName' which would be searched for upon each login. You can set whatever permissions you want for this room to make it discoverable or not.

People who wish to add you may do so by either typing in your rooms alias if it has one, or your internal ID if not.
The idea behind using this system is that we can provide the users a way to keep total control of their content via the rooms permissions control.

### Client

The client would be a single page webpage, which simplifys the process explained above. In addition to setting up the users room once matrix details have been given, it will listen for messages on each Bark room. It will then sort them into a single stream. The messages would be interactive (e.g. you can 'reblog' them). The client would also have the media features implemented like taking a picture or sharing a audio/video file.

Searching for users would be limited at first to your own homeserver since matrix doesn't have a global index system, but you can add people by internalID or alias (the latter being automatic if it exists). Bark rooms would have an included state event to ensure that the room is 'Bark' compatible. One way we could work around the issue of searching could be a global 'phonebook' approach. A room on matrix.org would be dedicated to listing clients by display name and sender id which would be optional. Users could search this room to find people to subscribe to.

I would also implement a few new event types which would not be well represented by the 'm.room.message' type.

##### 'org.bark.repost'

It's currently not easy to quote a person in another room, which is essentially what reposting is. The event would have a field for the quoted event id and the stream that sent it so the client could find the post and get information about it's body, likes and other stats if available.

##### 'org.bark.like'

Essentially, this would be posted whenever you click like on a persons post. It would be send to the stream and then other clients can count each like for a post by the linked event id inside.

##### 'org.bark.user'

This would list a user's (current at the time) display name, sender id and (current) biography. These would be posted to dedicated 'phonebook' rooms which would allow people to do simple searches for users.

## Deliverables

- I plan to deliver a complete web based client (approximately 2000-4000 lines of source code) by the end of the development period. More specifically, this means the styling, javascript source code and html documents used to develop it.
- Full documentation on creating extensions and improvements to 'Bark'.

## Milestones

### ⚀ Milestone 1 : Basic Functionality

My first milestone for the project would be to deliver on the basic aims of the project.
The CSS would be minimal right now as at this stage I will be focusing on good code quality first.

- Connecting to and from Matrix in the client.
- Setting up the user
 - 'Stream' Room
- Sending and reciving messages.
- Subscribing to other people
- Showing all the messages in a timeline
- A minimal form of user profile, probably just enough to subscribe.


### ⚁ Milestone 2: User Interface

Milestone 2's objective is to have it ready for testing by anyone.
- Redesigned CSS with a central layout *will take the majority of the time*
- Settings dialogue to change privacy settings for a user.
- Reply feature
- Ability to see individual user profiles and streams.
- Browser features such as notifications.

In addition, I plan to give this to users to test and get some feedback.

### ⚂ Milestone 3: Extra Features and Testing

This milestone will be mainly checking that everything is in place
and the usability is there.

- Taking in feedback from testing, and working on features that seem reasonable.
- Small features (such as replying inside a message).
- Search functionality
- Checking the client is responsive for phones,tablets and other devices.
- May be limited to homeservers, depending on how I plan to do it.
- Testing, testing and more testing.

## Extra features to implement at a later date
 - A bridge to services such as Twitter,Facebook,G+ etc.
  - Quite likely will be part of another project going on concurrently with my own, so I'll leave this discussion until     after the GSoC period.
 - Calling users directly through the client.
 - Threading support in Matrix has been a long awaited feature, and obviously would be a great addition to the client's replying system. However the task would require developments to be made inside Synapse and out of scope for this project.
