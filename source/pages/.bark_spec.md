## Terms

**Stream Room / SR** - The room in which the user has designated to be their 'stream', which includes all their posts and where other people will send events related to the user such as likes.

## Event Types

### like

The 'like' event is a simple room event which is related to any post event. It should be accumulated with other likes on the same event to show a 'like count' for a post. This event can be redacted to unlike a post at a later time.

| Name                  | Expected Type | Description                           |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |       
| **type**              | string        | Always "org.halfshot.bark.like".      |
| **event_id**          | string        | The globally unique event identifier. |
| **content.related_to**| string        | The post event the user liked.|
| **sender**            | string        | Contains the fully-qualified ID of the user who sent this event. |
| **room_id**           | string        | This room id should be the same as the SR |

#### Example

```
 {
    "type":"org.halfshot.bark.like",
    "event_id":"$146271051612687qlVIS:half-shot.uk",
    "sender": "@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk",
    "room_id": "!UcYsUzyxTGDxLBEvLz:matrix.org",
    "content":
    {
      "related_to":"$146271083312688bUGFr:half-shot.uk"
    }
 }
```

### repost

The 'repost' event is basically a redirect to another event in another persons SR. The "related_to" field should be resolved when encountered and the body of that event should be shown in place of this event, with the appropriate formatting to show it is a repost.

| Name                        | Expected Type | Description                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |       
| **type**                    | string        | Always "org.halfshot.bark.repost".    |
| **event_id**                | string        | The globally unique event identifier. |
| **sender**                  | string        | Contains the fully-qualified ID of the user who sent this event. |
| **room_id**                 | string        | This room id should be the same as the *reposters* SR. |
| **content.related_to**      | string        | The post event the user reposted.     |
| **content.related_to_room** | string        | The room id of the SR the repost is related to |

#### Example

```
 {
    "type":"org.halfshot.bark.repost",
    "event_id":"$146271051612687qlVIS:half-shot.uk",
    "sender": "@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk",
    "room_id": "!UcYsUzyxTaiufmdvLz:matrix.org",
    "content":{
      "related_to":"$146271083312688bUGFr:half-shot.uk",
      "related_to_room":"!UcYsUzyxTGDxLBEvLz:matrix.org"
    }
 }
```

### user

The 'user' event is special in that it only should be send automatically to certain rooms a few times in total. Due to the distributed nature of matrix, it's not easy to find a user by displayname/username outside of the ones you have met and the ones on your HS. Bark aims to bridge this gap by offering a 'phonebook' style system which means a 'user' event is inserted into a commonly known room amongst bark users (which is entirely optional), and thus users may search this room for keywords in order to find another user.

Users may update their entry by resending the event, and thus old events will be discarded.

| Name                       | Expected Type | Description                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |       
| **type**                   | string        | Always "org.halfshot.bark.user".        |
| **event_id**               | string        | The globally unique event identifier.   |
| **content.stream_room_id** | string        | The room id of the SR the user has set. |
| **sender**                 | string        | Contains the fully-qualified ID of the user who sent this event. |
| **room_id**                | string        | This room id should be the as the phonebook room. |

#### Example

```
{
    "type":"org.halfshot.bark.user",
    "content":{
      "stream_room_id":"!UcYsbmsigjhfxLBEvLz:matrix.org"
    },
    "event_id":"$146271051612687qlVIS:half-shot.uk",
    "sender": "@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk",
    "room_id": "!UcYsUzyxTGDxLBEvLz:matrix.org"
}
```
