## Bark, Microblogging for Matrix

The initial plan was to create a brand new microblogging system for Matrix which
would be completed in the time span given. As it currently stands, 'Bark' is not
ready since it was decided that a Twitter 'bridge'* should be written as an experiment.
This was decided to both scratch an itch for the Matrix project which makes
use of Twitter but cannot use it under their own platform, and to demonstrate
a **working example of a microblogging platform** without the overhead of it's
internals.

Over the course of the coding period, I have written a [complete solution](https://half-shot.github.io/matrix-appservice-twitter/) to interact with Twitter over Matrix. In addition, I have provided fixes and changes
to other parts of Matrix as I came across them. While I had hoped to create
my own solution, it would be more beneficial for Matrix to work with existing
solutions before we strike out on our own. I fully intend to move onto creating
Bark after the GSoC period and to continue contributing to Matrix.

\* A bridge allows the Matrix platform to communicate with another seamlessly
