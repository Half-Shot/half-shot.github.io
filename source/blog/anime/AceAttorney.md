Well I discussed this at great length. Like, as a fan who has been following the series for a while I was as hyped as it was possible to be. I counted down the days and streamed it as soon as the UK got it. And we got...something weird. I'm going to hopefully digest why I think it feels weird (not going to say bad yet) and about giving A1 pictures the benefit of the doubt...right now.

### The pacing

*To anyone who gets upset that I call it a game when it's technically a VN (Yeah, some people class these as entirely different things despite them being on the same platforms). I'm terribly sorry that you get hung up on that stuff*

My biggest gripe was the pacing. We got all of about 5 minutes to get to grips that Ryuuichi Naruhodou is a rookie defense lawyer *somewhere* in japan and that he wants to lend a favor to his friend. No other back-story given. Exactly the same as the game. My issue is that this **isn't** a game, and that is why the pacing feels off.

And I think that is the real issue here. In a game, it changes pace rapidly. You can spend 5 minutes mulling over a piece of evidence or testimony and it's fine because you are playing. A player is always entertained when they are doing something with their brain. In this, we aren't expected to work it out. We aren't even given time. I probably don't even suffer the worst of it because I know all the cases to the minute details at this point, but someone new to the series might have a hard time.

However, I want to point out something that a few people have missed. This was a very small case. It was a tutorial, with a prosecutor famous for having very little presence. I think it's fair to give a little benefit of the doubt to this episode on the basis there is very little meat to the source material. I THINK A1 could have made the effort to expand it a fraction, but fair enough they wanted to keep fans happy (ironically, not successfully). The other cases are full fat *investigation* cases with Miles *fucking* Edgeworth which will span multiple episodes so I hope the pacing will be good.

### The 3D

No 3D. The originals didn't have it, and you are using the original source material. And let's be real here, it's a fucking court room; It's about as dynamic as a room full of recently painted walls.  The characters are what's important to AA (at least inside the courtroom), and the 3D is just distracting. I've not found a single person to like the effect, so I have no idea why A1 went to the expense of doing it. We've not seen a investigation, and I'd like them to also remain 2D but I would be a little more receptive in a more dynamic environment.

### The goofiness

This is a small point. I'm generally good with AA's brand of humor, but it felt a little awkward in the first episode. Larry (sorry, I'm English) was quite funny, but Sahwit conjuring up air and throwing phoenix to the floor? No, it's a little too far for me. I like the breakdowns, but I just don't like random 'magical' crap like that. The courtrooms are by all means really goofy, but they have to have a tiny bit of reality to them. Sahwit's hair falling out? I can believe that. Sahwit using his unknown power of the elements to kick Phoenix's mind into gear? A step to far. It's not really a huge issue for me, but I think it's perhaps something to keep in mind.

### But the soundtrack?

It's pretty awesome. They have a good mix of classics (which I had to crank up the volume for) and some new ones for ambiance. I actually liked some new and some old, it helped remind me that this is NOT the same as the 2002 game.

### So, it's a flop?

I understand that people are looking at the first episode after all this time and expecting the worst, but I made that mistake of watching *Steins;Gate* all those years ago and the very first episode wasn't all that interesting to me. It just wasn't. It was about a 7/10 on the scale and in my young brain that didn't keep me watching. Now again, I face a anime that is about a 6.5, but as a fan I know the games got better as they progressed. So I will be giving A1 pictures the benefit of the doubt for one more episode before I begin to loose my faith in them.
