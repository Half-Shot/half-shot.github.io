Okay so it's been a while since I've published on this blog so let's try and do things in order, paragraph by paragraph.

I started and finished my GSOC project. There is quite a lot to say on that topic. Overall I'm happy with my effort and the process. The initial project was to create a microblogging system on top of Matrix, but due to time constraints we ended up implementing Twitter (as a bridge) for the time, which has the bonus of bridging that network onto my new system whenever it is ready. I'm happy with how it turned out and I've already found it useful. I hope to continue working on it to iron out bugs and get all the feature requests jammed in there.

The next thing is that I picked myself up from my previous thing and I kinda got together with a person I've kinda known as long as I've been able to program. This is going to sound really stupid, but I kinda always had repressed feelings for this guy but I'm a really terrible person when it comes to displaying them. Anyway, turns out we still have the same connection we always did and it basically feels like dating your best friend. I still have a few issues which I want to talk about last of all on this post, but yeah, I feel great about it.

I've moved into my new place at Portsmouth. A nice shared house between me and 4 other students that should keep us going during my second year at Uni. I only came down with a bag full of my stuff, since I trained here with the boyfriend so I'm kinda missing my Desktop, which is the only device I like to program on. Which means things are behind Matrix wise because I can't work on them :/

So the final thing is a bit of a worry, but when are my problems not. I've started to sort of feel a bit bipolar as of late. I can't tell for certain, but I think it might be to do with my relationship :s. I always feel great when I'm around him and usually for a few days after and then my mood starts to dip. And it sort of snowballs from there until I start to get angry at myself and I start to doubt everything and everyone. I get angry at *him* for reasons I can't explain. I get angry at myself for being angry at him and then I feel like maybe I should break up with him to spare myself the pain of it all. I know that entire line of logic is stupid, because I feel good around him.

Occasionally I just lie around contemplating things and ignoring messages, feeling like I'm being weak if I respond. I have issues telling people that I feel down because I feel like I will bring them down. Worse still, they might shrug it off which makes me feel like an idiot. Words kind of bounce off me too, because once I get in this mood, I tend to think the worst of myself and any contradictions to that are ignored.

I hate this. I hate not being able to be truthful to the person that matters the most to me. I am a walking fucking contradiction in itself. I pride myself on being open about things so that people are that way with me, but I can't even discuss basic things like my mood. It feels like doing so would be to admit a weakness, and as much as I try to promise to ignore that sense of pride, I can't help but hide away from help.

Now, all of this was fine before. Because when I felt at my absolute worst I always visited him (usually at his request, because I refused to admit that I need it). Now...we live ~90 miles apart which Southern Rail makes to be Â£45 so it's not like I can do that anymore. 

Anyway, this is my cooldown period. I am cooling off from a summer of relationships and code and trying to adjust to my regular life of study and solidarity.
