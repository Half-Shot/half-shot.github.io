I wasn't sure if I had the guts to write this one but if there is one thing I am, it's stubborn. I have to write this because otherwise another poor soul is going to get the full experience of me venting at them and I'd rather put it on the internet in an easily dismissable form.

So for the last 6 or so years I've had been trying to remain in the dark. I wanted to learn programming and computer science and I didn't want anything to get in the way of it. I (yes this is cringe) wanted to be cold and keep *some* emotions out of me because they had no place in where I wanted to go. I guess as I got more experienced I started to mellow **a bit**.

I started to be more open and carefree about myself. I realised that people didn't really care what I said and I could be really what I wanted. I felt healthier for it and it made life feel good again. The programming used to keep me going but now I had two fallbacks:
-  Being able to socialise without fear of anything.
-  Writing coding projects

This was going great and I soon got involved with a few notable projects and landed myself on GSoC (which I'm extremely grateful for, so far it's been awesome).

However, this 50/50 divide started to become more 20/80 as I tried to claw back what I had missed out on before. I went out with friends and started to really get to know people online. I was reckless and although I still had a little paranoia about my relationships with people, I didn't let it get to me. About mid/late April I met a person who I thought needed my help. I knew I felt pretty good about myself and I wanted to help them too. I didn't want to listen to them *directly* because of my sheer arrogance and I kept on living in the bubble of now having a relationship with someone (in a wildly different timezone) while also trying to do my work.

I helped a guy out recently with his breakup because his SO wanted to date someone else (who was more local than ~700 miles away) and he was having a rough time of it. I made him go out and do stuff with the rest of our friend group and we just *did* things. I think it helped him a lot and I'm glad to have helped him. However, there is a certain irony to this whole story.

The person who I was """dating""" was really having a bad time and I felt **awful**. I had no means of contact and I couldn't eat or sleep knowing they was out my reach but suffering. Yesterday I finally got in contact with him after about a 24 hour period of radio silence and I find out they were okay. But there was more. They had actually *been* with someone for over 6 months and hadn't wanted to tell me.

 Yep. So now I really don't know how to feel at all. Part of me wants to rip everything apart and sink back into what I was before, but part of me wants to shrug it off and keep going. I can't hate him for what they did as I still *hope* they did it for the right reasons but I can't shake the doubt that I was just used. I just can't bring myself to hate them, I really can't. As far as I'm aware we are still friends and I'm considered "Plan B".

 Of course, all that does is feed the small bit of my mind that wants to hang on. I hate that. With other things coming up on the horizon it's hardly like I'm going to have nothing to do. It's easy to section of part of you to connect with another person, but it's not so easy to reattach. As much as I kinda hate myself for saying it, I know I overextended myself and I'm going to be careful from now on, consider this one a teenage mistake which I should have made years a go.

 I'm just glad I still have the friends who I have made over the years, you're probably the reason I still have any sanity left.
