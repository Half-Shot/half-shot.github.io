I volunteer my efforts at the UK's largest Furry convention, [ConFuzzled](https://confuzzled.org.uk). As one half of the web team, I have worked to transform
the aging static Wordpress into something that could be trusted and relied upon for attendees during the convention.

I have led efforts to:

 - Rewrite core components, such as the menu system for accessibility.
 - Integrate interactive components using React, within Wordpress using web components.
 - Develop a event schedule widget for attendees to view during the convention.
 - Work on building a faster, leaner alternative to Wordpress that caters to attendee needs.
