One of my passion projects has been to build a complete worms-like in the browser. I've spent time building 
nearly all the component pieces from the ground up, and donated the project to the free software community
in the hopes that it might help other developers get started on their own project.

The game features:

 - A terrain system that can be generated from any bitmap source, with full physics support.
 - A complete logic system for managing the round state, player entities, damage and more.
 - Support for network play over the Matrix protocol.
 - A focus on testing, with a well-developed unit test system to ensure consistency.
 - Plenty of "developer art"!

The code lives at [github.com/Half-Shot/wormgine](https://github.com/Half-Shot/wormgine). You can give the game a try by
going to [half-shot.github.io/wormgine/](https://half-shot.github.io/wormgine/).

And finally, you can see a thorough explanation of the game [over here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gMt8nsadCg)
