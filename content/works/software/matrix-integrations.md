I've spent a dissying amount of years trying to improve the Matrix ecosystem, mostly around bridges.

Initially this was building [Twitter](https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-twitter) and [Discord](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-discord) bridges but eventually this became more centered around richer client usability.

This eventually led to the creation of the [Hookshot bridge](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot), but in particular the ability for bridges to surface their own [UI to clients via widgets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlsMMzTFZ_A).
