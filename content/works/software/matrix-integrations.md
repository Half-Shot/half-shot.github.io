My career has has a major focus on improving the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) integration ecosystem. Integrations are pieces of software that extend the underlying protocol to talk to
other services. For instance, an integration for Discord exists that allows users on Matrix to talk to them and vice versa.

Over my time at Matrix, I have built up [an IRC bridge](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc), a [Discord](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-discord) bridge and
even a multi-service bridge for project management, [Hookshot](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot).
