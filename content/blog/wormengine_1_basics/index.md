### What's next!

I'm still actively working on this project at the moment, so hopefully there will be a few more
posts coming out over the next fewe weeks and months. I expect my next topic will delve into **physics
and terrain** which might excite some of you!

As mentioned I'm building this project in the public domain. You can see it at [https://github.com/Half-Shot/wormgine](https://github.com/Half-Shot/wormgine).
I won't yet be looking at contibutions unless they are staggeringly good, so don't take offence if I don't review any issues or PRs you may open. In time once I'm happy with the core fundamentals I'd like to open
this up to community work though.

And if you have any questions, you can always ask on [the mastodon thread](https://mastodon.half-shot.uk/@halfy/halfy-fill-this-in)

Thanks for reading!
