### Introduction

I use the phrase "ADHD enjoyer" a lot when when talking to friends. Part of that is to make light of the
condition, as if it's not all that present in my life and I just happen to enjoy it in pieces. This is
absolutely false though, it's deeply sewn into me and every thought and decision I make has the stitchings
of someone who struggles with planning and execution.

This post is broadly to highlight the things that I see are currently hostile to people who work in an office
environment. I come from a tech background in a startup so my experiences will be within that bubble, but I hope
that regardless of background, you may be able to relate this to your experience as well.

Before I get into it, I want to broadly explain *who* this is for. I don't intend this article for just ADHD diagnosed
folks, or even people who exhibit a lot of the symptoms. This is for everyone. Studies put the number of people
who have been diagnosed with ADHD at 3-4% in adults[3] which means you **will** encounter this problem, even if
only from an external point of view. 

Broadly what I want to get across here is that while it would be cruel to drag a wheel chair user
up a flight of stairs check the box for accessibility; it is equally wrong to expect a person with ADHD to
work in an environment that fights them.

For those who want a primer on the condition itself, I suggest having a read of https://adhduk.co.uk/. I've
personally been reading / watching content from [Jessica McCabe](https://www.youtube.com/c/HowtoADHD/videos)
who has been banging the drum on this cause for longer than I've been aware of it.
