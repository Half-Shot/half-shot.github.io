Halfy blogposts are like buses, you wait half a year for one and then two come along at once.
Anyway, this one is cooked up fresh from the mind of someone who's just gone back to work.

## Intro

When I was 5 or 6, I loved computers. This was the early 2000s when everyone had a big green
hill and blue skies on their recently flattened monitors, and computers could now do everything!

I used to make little websites that did horrible flashy effects, make animations in Macromedia Flash
and play Worms Armageddon with my brothers. Grandfather Halfy was not so keen. He was a proud luddite
who at that age left me with the impression he was burning down warehouses full of computers on his weekends.
I suspect that was no more true than the gold he hid under his floorboards, but I do remember the most advanced
bit of tech in the house was a DVD recorder. Otherwise, nothing. And it facinated me.

Growing up I remember that I did not want to be that person. I **loved** computers because I could do so much
and later would make friends through computers, get paid through them and even fall in love through
meeting people on those connections. The idea of burning down those would burn down my life's ambitions.

There is a big part of me that believes in keeping up with the times and adapting to change, but try as I might
I cannot love AI. LLMs appear constantly around what I do, and they never spark that joy. I've now connected
with my late grandfather's words about wanting to burn them down.


## This does not spark joy.

And I think the problem I fundamentally have with AI on a personal level is that computers are to me a way to
express my creativity. I've gotten hired off that creative ability to reason around a problem, and I've given
much fulfillment to my life through making music, drawing, photoshopping or building random janky websites as
a meme.

I can't see the joy in filling a prompt and getting some output. That's just hiring someone to experience the
joy for you. The computer can't feel joy, so nobody wins. What a result.

And aside from the occasional bit of faux-enjoyment where a Reddit post turns out to be fake, I'm managing to
dodge AI. In truth, I'm hoping it eventually fades the same way blockchain, NFTs and the other monsters did.

## But I'm angry

And right now I'm angry in the same way my Science teacher graded me down for not labeling my axis on a graph;
**PEOPLE ARE NOT LABELING THEIR SHIT**. 

I get it, you like AI. That's cool for you, and I don't want to burn down your ambitions. But for the love of
god, stop burning the goodwill of everyone else and just label that whatever you just generated contains AI.

I'm reading Reddit posts pretending to be humans, I'm seeing YouTube videos so obviously AI that I can't filter
out. I'm reviewing code from community members written by AI that will *never* work.

On the software side, I'm noticing a much more worrying trend where AI has now allowed contributors to pick off
issues they don't like, generate some crap code, and then expect the maintainers to form it into a fix. I want
to believe these people think they are helping.

Let me be clear; rather than oiling the gears, **you are filling them with mud.**

## So to be clear

I am probably never going to get on with AI, however good it gets. I enjoy the learning curve of a craft, I
get a lot out of fixing bugs with my human brain and I will play and sing in terrible quality til the day
I depart this Earth. I am not interested in the quality or productiveness, I get a thrill from just the
experience.

But I don't want to trample on the fun people have with generating content, if that's their bag then they
may have their cake. All that I ask is that you let us luddites know that you consulted an AI, roughly
how much of that work is your own, and give us the ability to decide whether we want to engage with it.
