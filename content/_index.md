Hi there! I'm Halfy and I work on things that make the internet better! This might be
open and secure communcations protocols, accessible web design or just contributing
code where code is needed. Either way, I'm looking to help!

My activites include writing, occasional flecks of music and art and running long distances
while pretending nothing hurts!

[See what I'm working on][/works]

I am also always on the lookout for new work, so feel free to [contact me](/contact)
if you have something that might fit my [skillset](/hireme).
