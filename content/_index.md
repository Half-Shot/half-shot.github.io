Hi there! I'm Halfy and I work on things that make the internet better! This might be
open and secure communcations protocols, accessible web design or just contributing
code where code is needed. Either way, I'm looking to help!

My activites include writing, occasional flecks of music and art and I've recently
started to become an enthusiastic runner.

This site mainly exists as a testament to the things that [I have worked on](/works).
I also occasionally [blog about things.](/blog)

I am also always on the lookout for new work, so feel free to [contact me](/contact)
if you have something that might fit my skillset.
