# Hiring

Hi there, if you've made it to this page then you're probably looking to see what I could contribute to your project. You've probably already skimmed
[the works page](/works), or perhaps read my [CV](https://cv.half-shot.uk/). I won't rehash all those projects here, but if you are looking to hire
then I'm available at short notice for contract work.

Specifically, I would be a good match for:

 - Website development, particularly if it involves React/Vue/Next.JS.
 - Specalist interactive content on the web, such as games.
 - Backend integration pieces.
 - CI pipeline improvements (GitHub actions).


I have a natural ability to jump into a project and get moving quickly, so if any of this is
interesting to you, i'm always available [for a chat](/contact).
