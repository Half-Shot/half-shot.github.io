============
This is the git repository containing the content and source code of my site.
As the licence dictates, you can Do What the Fuck You Want to.
I mean, I'd *like* it if you'd reference me somewhere if you take bits from the site but I don't care enough to enforce it.

This git repo automatically sinks with [Half-Shot.uk](https://half-shot.uk).
Also syncs to halfshot.uk,halfshot.lol and half-shot.lol.
