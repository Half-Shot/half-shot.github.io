### half-shot.uk

This site is built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) after having watched my friend
[Thib](https://github.com/thibaultamartin) have great success with it on [matrix.org](https://matrix.org).

This repository is automatically built and reverse proxied up to [half-shot.uk](https://half-shot.uk).

I couldn't keep using [half-shot.uk](half-shot.uk) as a repository name,
as the only way to serve `half-shot.github.io` is to call your repository
the same name.
